# Housing Price Prediction: Ensemble Stacking Regressor and Regression Models

A comprehensive case study on predicting housing prices using the Stacking Regressor from `sklearn.ensemble` alongside individual regression models such as linear regression, k-nearest neighbors (KNN) regressor, and decision tree regressor. The project focuses on leveraging ensemble learning techniques and statistical modeling for effective prediction.

## üåü Key Learnings

1. **Feature Significance**:
   - Analyzed the influence of features such as `area`, `bedrooms`, and `stories` on housing prices.
   - Utilized visualizations and statistical methods to highlight significant predictors.

2. **Model Performance**:
   - Compared the performance of individual models, including Linear Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Decision Tree Regressors.
   - Observed improved accuracy by combining models through the Stacking Regressor.

3. **Evaluation Metrics**:
   - Assessed model quality using the R-squared metric to explain variance in housing prices.
   - Used the OLS module from `statsmodels` for detailed statistical insights.

4. **Ensemble Techniques**:
   - Highlighted how the Stacking Regressor combines the strengths of multiple models to achieve better predictive performance.
