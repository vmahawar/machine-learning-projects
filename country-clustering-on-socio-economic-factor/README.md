# Country Clustering on Socio-Economic Factors

This repository demonstrates how to use clustering techniques to analyze socio-economic and health-related indicators across countries. By leveraging data science tools and methodologies, the project aims to group countries based on similarities in various development metrics, providing insights into global disparities and patterns.

## üìÇ Dataset

### **Country Dataset**
- **Description**: This dataset contains various socio-economic and health-related metrics for countries worldwide, including child mortality, trade statistics, health expenditure, income levels, inflation, life expectancy, fertility rates, and GDP.
- **Use Cases**: 
  - Exploring correlations between economic indicators and health outcomes.
  - Predictive modeling for development indices.
  - Clustering countries based on socio-economic factors.
  - Trend analysis of economic growth and health expenditure.
  - Visualizing global economic and health disparities.

- **Data Dictionary**:  
  - **country**: Name of the country (categorical).  
  - **child_mort**: Child mortality rate, deaths per 1000 live births (numerical).  
  - **exports**: Exports as a percentage of GDP (numerical).  
  - **health**: Health expenditure as a percentage of GDP (numerical).  
  - **imports**: Imports as a percentage of GDP (numerical).  
  - **income**: Per capita income in USD (numerical).  
  - **inflation**: Inflation rate, annual percentage (numerical).  
  - **life_expec**: Life expectancy in years (numerical).  
  - **total_fer**: Total fertility rate, average number of children per woman (numerical).  
  - **gdpp**: GDP per capita in USD (numerical).

- **File Reference**: [country-data.csv](https://github.com/vmahawar/data-science-datasets-collection/raw/main/country-data.csv)

  ```python
  import pandas as pd

  # URL for the dataset
  url = 'https://github.com/vmahawar/data-science-datasets-collection/raw/main/country-data.csv'

  # Load the dataset
  df = pd.read_csv(url)

  # Print the first 5 rows to verify
  print(df.head())
  ```
