### üåü Key Learnings

1. **Feature Importance**:
   - Gained insights into how attributes like safety and maintenance cost influence car evaluation.
   - Used `feature_importances_` from Scikit-learn to identify key features driving predictions.

2. **Decision Tree Tuning**:
   - Learned how hyperparameters such as `max_depth`, `min_samples_split`, and `criterion` (e.g., Gini, Entropy) impact the model's accuracy and interpretability.

3. **Evaluation Metrics**:
   - Explored metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to assess model performance.
   - Focused on achieving a balance between overfitting and underfitting by tuning model complexity.

4. **Visualization**:
   - Developed skills in visualizing Decision Trees and understanding their splits.
   - Enhanced the ability to represent categorical data relationships through pair plots, heatmaps, and other visualizations.
