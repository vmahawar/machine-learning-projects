## üìÇ Projects

### 1. [Exploratory Data Analysis and Machine Learning for predicting loan defaults using Python.](./credit-loan-default-eda/)
- **Description**: A project that utilizes Decision Tree models to predict heart disease outcomes. The project includes feature analysis, hyperparameter tuning, and model evaluation.

### 2. [RSVP Movies SQL Case Study](./rsvp-movies-sql-case-study/)
- **Description**: In this project, I analyzed the RSVP Movies dataset using MySQL to derive key insights into movie trends, genres, ratings, and industry success. Through advanced SQL queries, I explored director and actor performance, production house rankings, and genre-based analysis. This project highlights my expertise in SQL query design, data exploration, and delivering actionable insights for real-world datasets.

### 3. [Bike Sharing Prediction using Linear Regression](./bike-sharing-linear-regression/)
- **Description**: In this project, I analyzed bike-sharing system data to predict user demand using Linear Regression. Key steps included data exploration, feature engineering (using manual and automatic like RFE), and model development to identify the relationship between environmental conditions and bike usage and performance evaluation. The model provides actionable insights for optimizing bike availability and resource allocation. I used libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn

### 4. [Heart Disease Prediction Using Decision Tree](./heart-disease-prediction-dt/)
- **Description**: A project that utilizes Decision Tree models to predict heart disease outcomes. The project includes feature analysis, hyperparameter tuning, and model evaluation.

### 5. [Housing Price Prediction Using Decision Tree](./housing-price-prediction-dt/)
- **Description**: A project that predicts housing prices using Decision Tree models. It explores feature engineering, hyperparameter optimization, and regression modeling.

### 6. [Car Evaluation Prediction Using Decision Tree](./car-evaluation-prediction-dt/)
- **Description**: A project explors the car evluation datasets using Decision Tree models. It explores feature engineering, hyperparameter optimization, and regression modeling.
