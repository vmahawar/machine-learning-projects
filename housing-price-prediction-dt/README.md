## üåü Key Learnings

1. **Feature Importance**:
   - Identified key features like `Lot Area` and `Overall Quality` that influence housing prices.
   - Used `feature_importances_` from Scikit-learn to rank features by significance.

2. **Decision Tree Tuning**:
   - Experimented with parameters such as `max_depth` and `min_samples_split` to optimize model accuracy and control overfitting.

3. **Evaluation Metrics**:
   - Evaluated model performance using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R¬≤ Score.
   - Learned to interpret the trade-offs between underfitting and overfitting.

4. **Visualization**:
   - Developed visualizations to interpret Decision Tree splits and the hierarchy of features.
   - Enhanced data understanding through scatter plots, histograms, and pair plots.
