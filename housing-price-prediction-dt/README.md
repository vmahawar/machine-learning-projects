## üìÇ Dataset

### **Housing Prices Dataset**
- **Description**: This dataset includes features affecting housing prices, such as lot area, building quality, and construction year.
- **Use Cases**: Regression tasks, feature engineering, and exploratory data analysis.
- **Data Dictionary**:
  - **Lot Area**: Lot size in square feet.
  - **Overall Quality**: Rates the overall material and finish of the house (1 to 10).
  - **Year Built**: Year the house was constructed.
  - **Sale Price**: Price of the property in dollars.
- **File Reference**: [housing_prices.csv](https://github.com/vmahawar/data-science-datasets-collection/raw/main/housing_prices.csv)
  ```python
  import pandas as pd
  url = 'https://github.com/vmahawar/data-science-datasets-collection/raw/main/housing_prices.csv'
  df = pd.read_csv(url)
  print(df.head())
  ```

## üåü Key Learnings

1. **Feature Importance**:
   - Identified key features like `Lot Area` and `Overall Quality` that influence housing prices.
   - Used `feature_importances_` from Scikit-learn to rank features by significance.

2. **Decision Tree Tuning**:
   - Experimented with parameters such as `max_depth` and `min_samples_split` to optimize model accuracy and control overfitting.

3. **Evaluation Metrics**:
   - Evaluated model performance using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R¬≤ Score.
   - Learned to interpret the trade-offs between underfitting and overfitting.

4. **Visualization**:
   - Developed visualizations to interpret Decision Tree splits and the hierarchy of features.
   - Enhanced data understanding through scatter plots, histograms, and pair plots.
