## üåü Key Learnings

1. **Feature Importance**:
   - Analyzed the significance of features like `age`, `sex`, and `cholestrol` using the `feature_importances_` attribute from the Decision Tree model.

2. **Hyperparameter Tuning**:
   - Experimented with various hyperparameters to optimize the Decision Tree, including:
     - `max_depth`: To control the depth of the tree.
     - `min_samples_split`: To specify the minimum number of samples required to split an internal node.
     - `min_samples_leaf`: To define the minimum number of samples at a leaf node.
   - Utilized `Grid Search` and `Randomized Search` for finding the best combination of parameters.

3. **Model Evaluation**:
   - Evaluated the performance of the Decision Tree model using classification metrics such as Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1 Score.
   - Assessed the effects of hyperparameter tuning on model performance to improve classification results.

4. **Visualization**:
   - Created visualizations to interpret the Decision Tree hierarchy and splits.
   - Used confusion matrices, scatter plots, and histograms for insights into data patterns and model predictions.
