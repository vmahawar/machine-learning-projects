## ðŸ“‚ Dataset

### **Heart Disease Dataset**
- **Description**: Contains medical data used to predict the likelihood of heart disease in a patient.
- **Use Cases**: Classification, predictive modeling, and exploratory data analysis.
- **Data Dictionary**:
  - **Age**: Age of the patient.
  - **Sex**: Gender of the patient (1 = male, 0 = female).
  - **Chest Pain Type**: Type of chest pain experienced (e.g., typical angina, atypical angina).
  - **Resting Blood Pressure**: Blood pressure at rest.
  - **Cholesterol**: Serum cholesterol levels in mg/dl.
  - **Max Heart Rate Achieved**: Maximum heart rate achieved during exercise.
  - **Target**: Diagnosis of heart disease (1 = disease, 0 = no disease).
- **File Reference**: [heart_disease.csv](https://github.com/vmahawar/data-science-datasets-collection/raw/main/heart_disease.csv)
  ```python
  import pandas as pd
  url = 'https://github.com/vmahawar/data-science-datasets-collection/raw/main/heart_disease.csv'
  df = pd.read_csv(url)
  print(df.head())
  ```

## Tools and Libraries Used

The project leverages the following tools and libraries:

- **Pandas**: For data manipulation, preprocessing, and exploratory data analysis.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For creating data visualizations to understand feature relationships.
- **Scikit-learn**: For building, training, and visualizing the Decision Tree model.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For interactive coding and presenting the analysis.

## Key Learnings

1. **Feature Importance**:
   - Learned how attributes like age, cholesterol levels, and resting blood pressure influence heart disease predictions.
   - Utilized `feature_importances_` from Scikit-learn to identify impactful features.

2. **Hyperparameter Tuning**:
   - Explored the effects of hyperparameters such as `max_depth` and `criterion` (e.g., Gini, Entropy) on the Decision Tree's accuracy and interpretability.

3. **Model Evaluation**:
   - Applied metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to evaluate the model's performance.
   - Learned to balance overfitting and underfitting by pruning the decision tree.

4. **Visualization**:
   - Created tree visualizations to understand decision splits and the hierarchy of features.
   - Improved skills in visualizing relationships between features and target variables using pair plots, histograms, and scatter plots.
