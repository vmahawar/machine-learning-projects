## üåü Key Learnings

1. **Feature Importance**:
   - Analyzed feature significance using `feature_importances_` from the Random Forest Regressor.
   - Highlighted key features like `area`, `bedrooms`, and `stories` that strongly influence housing prices.

2. **Hyperparameter Tuning**:
   - Experimented with parameters such as `n_estimators`, `max_depth`, and `min_samples_split` to optimize model performance.
   - Observed the impact of different parameter settings on prediction accuracy.

3. **Evaluation Metrics**:
   - Assessed model performance using metrics such as R-squared and Mean Absolute Error (MAE).
   - Compared predictions with actual housing prices to evaluate accuracy.

4. **Random Forest Capabilities**:
   - Demonstrated the strength of Random Forest in handling complex feature interactions and reducing overfitting through ensemble decision trees.
