# AIoT Project: Motion Sensing and Classification

![motion-sensing-ai](./images/motion-sensing-ai.png)

## Project Summary
This AIoT project utilizes an ESP32 microcontroller, an MPU6050 accelerometer/gyroscope sensor, an LCD display, and a potentiometer to build a real-time motion classification system. By leveraging a trained Random Forest machine learning model, the system identifies six different physical activities (e.g., bench press, overhead press, deadlift, squat, row, rest) and displays the results on the LCD. The system is designed for fitness tracking, sports performance monitoring, and real-time activity recognition. It integrates hardware and software to demonstrate a complete AIoT pipeline, from data collection and model training to deployment and visualization.

### Required Python Libraries
[Install the following Python libraries](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/tutorials/installing-packages/):
```bash
pip install pandas scikit-learn micromlgen
```

### Required PlatformIO Libraries
Add these libraries in the [`platformio.ini`](./config/platformio.ini) file:
- `LiquidCrystal`
- `Adafruit MPU6050`
- `Adafruit Unified Sensor`

### About `wokwi.toml`
The `wokwi.toml` file is a configuration file used by the [Wokwi simulator](https://wokwi.com/) to set up the simulation environment for your project. It specifies important details like the firmware binary file to be used and the ELF file for debugging purposes.

#### Key Configuration in `wokwi.toml`:
```toml
[wokwi]
version = 1
firmware = '.pio/build/adafruit_feather_esp32s3_nopsram/firmware.bin'
elf = '.pio/build/adafruit_feather_esp32s3_nopsram/firmware.elf'
```
- **`firmware`**: Points to the compiled firmware binary that runs on the ESP32 in the simulator.  
- **`elf`**: Points to the ELF file used for debugging the firmware in the Wokwi simulator.  

This file ensures that the simulation environment mirrors the real-world hardware configuration, allowing you to test your code effectively without physical hardware.

## Steps to Build the Project

### 1. Prepare Training Data
- **File**: [`motion_sensor.csv`](https://github.com/vmahawar/data-science-datasets-collection/raw/main/motion_sensor.csv)
  - Contains motion data with accelerometer and gyroscope readings.
  - Labels: `bench`, `ohp`, `dead`, `squat`, `row`, `rest`.
    - `bench`: Bench press.  
    - `ohp`: Overhead press.  
    - `dead`: Deadlift.  
    - `squat`: Squats.  
    - `row`: Barbell rows.  
    - `rest`: Inactivity or resting periods.

#### Dataset Description
- **Description**: This dataset contains motion sensor data collected from an MPU6050 sensor. It provides essential insights into various physical activities through accelerometer and gyroscope data, enabling real-time activity classification and motion analysis. Applications include fitness tracking, sports performance monitoring, and AI-powered activity recognition systems.

- **Use Cases**:
  - Train machine learning models for activity recognition.
  - Develop real-time AIoT systems for fitness tracking.
  - Analyze motion patterns for health and performance monitoring.

- **Data Dictionary**:
  - **epoch**: Timestamp of the data collection (numerical). Represents a Unix timestamp indicating the exact time each data point was recorded.
  - **Accelerometer_x**: Acceleration along the x-axis (numerical).
  - **Accelerometer_y**: Acceleration along the y-axis (numerical).
  - **Accelerometer_z**: Acceleration along the z-axis (numerical).
  - **Gyroscope_x**: Angular velocity around the x-axis (numerical).
  - **Gyroscope_y**: Angular velocity around the y-axis (numerical).
  - **Gyroscope_z**: Angular velocity around the z-axis (numerical).
  - **Label**: Activity performed (`bench`, `ohp`, `dead`, `squat`, `row`, `rest`) (categorical).

### 2. Train the Machine Learning Model
- **File**: [`motion_sense.ipynb`](./motion_sense.ipynb)
  - Preprocess the data and train a Random Forest classifier.
  - Convert the trained model into C code using the `micromlgen` library.

#### Steps in Jupyter Notebook:
1. Load the dataset.
2. Split the data into training and testing sets.
3. Train a Random Forest classifier.
4. Export the model to a header file:
   ```python
   from micromlgen import port
   c_code = port(clf, classmap=labels)
   with open("model.h", "w") as f:
       f.write(c_code)
   ```
5. Copy the generated `model.h` file to the `include/` directory of your PlatformIO project.

### 3. Set Up the PlatformIO Project
- **File**: [`platformio.ini`](./config/platformio.ini)
  - Create a new PlatformIO project for the ESP32-S3 board.
  - Add the required libraries in the `platformio.ini` file:
    ```ini
    [env:adafruit_feather_esp32s3_nopsram]
    platform = espressif32
    board = adafruit_feather_esp32s3_nopsram
    framework = arduino
    lib_deps =
        LiquidCrystal
        Adafruit MPU6050
        Adafruit Unified Sensor
    ```

---

### 4. Implement the Firmware
- **File**: [`main.cpp`](./src/main.cpp)
  - Write the code to:
    - Read accelerometer and gyroscope data from the MPU6050.
    - Use the Random Forest model to classify activities.
    - Display the result on the LCD.
    - Adjust the LCD brightness with the potentiometer.

---

### 5. Configure the Wokwi Simulator
- **File**: [`wokwi.toml`](./config/wokwi.toml)
  - Set up the Wokwi simulation environment using the following configuration:
    ```toml
    [wokwi]
    version = 1
    firmware = '.pio/build/adafruit_feather_esp32s3_nopsram/firmware.bin'
    elf = '.pio/build/adafruit_feather_esp32s3_nopsram/firmware.elf'
    ```
  - Launch the Wokwi simulator in VS Code to test the firmware.

---

### 6. Testing the Project
- Verify the system in both the Wokwi simulator and on real hardware.
- Expected outputs:
  - LCD displays the detected activity (e.g., "Motion: bench").
  - The potentiometer adjusts LCD brightness.
  - Results are logged to the Serial Monitor.
