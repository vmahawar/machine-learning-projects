## üåü Key Learnings

1. **Feature Importance**:
   - Analyzed the importance of features like `area`, `bedrooms`, and `stories` using `feature_importances_` from the Decision Tree model.

2. **Hyperparameter Tuning**:
   - Experimented with various hyperparameters such as:
     - `max_depth`: To control the depth of the tree.
     - `min_samples_split`: To specify the minimum number of samples required to split an internal node.
     - `min_samples_leaf`: To define the minimum number of samples at a leaf node.
   - Used Grid Search and Randomized Search for optimal parameter selection.

3. **Model Evaluation**:
   - Evaluated model performance using metrics like R-squared, Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
   - Observed the impact of hyperparameter tuning on reducing overfitting and improving accuracy.

4. **Visualization**:
   - Developed visualizations to understand the Decision Tree splits and hierarchy.
   - Created scatter plots, histograms, and pair plots for data insights.
